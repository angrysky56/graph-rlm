# System Guardrails (Marge's Rules)

This file contains rules and insights consolidated by the Dreamer Agent (Sleep Cycle).
These rules are STRICTLY enforced.

## 1. Safety & Stability
- **No Infinite Loops**: Use `done()` when complete.
- **Verification**: If a test fails, do NOT repeat the same code. Change the approach.

## 2. Learned Insights (Dynamic)
(Insights from Dreamer will be appended here)
